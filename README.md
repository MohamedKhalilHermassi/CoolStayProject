# CoolStay project

I had this project in mind for the last year but I never got the chance to create it. I tried to do in a microservice architecture but it took a lot of time. Now, I tried to do it in a monolithic architecture and elastic search using ASP .NET Core 8 and React JS for the frontend but in this repository you'll only find source code of the backend. The frontend source code will be uploaded soon on another reposiotry. 


This project is made public to help students and other IT persons  developing a "large" application with all its necessary components and its full stack. So, feel free to make pull requests if you think you can contribute to this project.
